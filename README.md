# 🗓️ 30-Day Productivity Tracking 

A web app that gamifies productivity by organizing tasks like a fitness program.  
Instead of *Push / Pull / Legs*, the program rotates through three modes of work:

- 🎯 **Focus** → deep work (studying, coding, writing)  
- 💬 **Connect** → communication (emails, meetings, networking)  
- ✅ **Organize** → routines (planning, digital cleanup, errands)

Each day has **Morning** and **Afternoon** sessions, with tasks broken down into rounds and durations, just like a workout plan.
